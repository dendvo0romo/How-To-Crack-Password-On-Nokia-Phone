Google Find My Device is a feature that allows you to locate, lock, or erase your Android device remotely. You can use this feature to crack password on Nokia phone by erasing all the data and settings on your device, which will also remove the screen lock. However, this method requires that you have enabled Find My Device on your Nokia phone before it was locked, and that your device is connected to the internet and signed in to your Google account.
